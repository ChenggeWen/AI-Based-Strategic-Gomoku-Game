Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more 
clever than just pick a random legal move?
Yes, I did. 
I treid lots of methods such as random chocie, then I turn to using lists and sets to 
memory several steps to help AI make decisions, then I found out that I could use 
scores to add them up for each empty position so that Ai accumulate each step and 
figure out which step is the best solution.

If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would
 like?
Yes, when I play with it sometimes I can't beat it.

How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” 
algorithm
Using list and scores to calculate and count each empty position to compare them and 
make Ai move basing on that.

How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it 
out for you?
Not sure the frequence but like we are drawn normally like about 50% percent?

How easy would it be to make the difficulty level adjustable?
I think it is not difficulty to change the scores and add some counting situations,
they are pretty flexible.

How would you improve it in the future?
I can think about more actual situations and prediction to provide more logical 
situations to make my algorithm more complete.
